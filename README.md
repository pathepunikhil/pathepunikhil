###Project Overview
The web application is built to provide a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for users to manage their tasks. The application is built using React and is hosted on AWS Amplify. The backend is built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. IAM is used for access control and authentication.
